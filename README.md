# Formula Dado
This is the first game I ever wrote, built as a dynamic web page that you can host on an Apache server!

This is not much, but it was my first ever experience trying programming for myself, outside of
the exercises that our teacher explained us in classes when I was 15.

This "game", which is very simple in its core, is a simplified recreation of a board game I created with
my friends which involved completing a predefined number of laps around a board on which special conditions
may affect the movement of your piece. The first to complete every lap wins the game.

The idea is based on Motorsport, hence the name of the game is "Formula Dado", which can be translated
to "Formula Dice", a similar name to its inspiration, which is Formula 1.

I hope you enjoy it!
